    My research focus on building computational tools for environmental data analysis. Although my main application field is biology and in particular the microbial world (metagenomics data), I'm also interested in application to ecology and geosciences. Go to the research interest or publications webpage for more details.

    I give several lectures related to data science at Ensimag (Grenoble INP group) in Universit√© Grenoble Alpes.
