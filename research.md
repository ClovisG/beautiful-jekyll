From geochemical cycles to human health, the microbiome play keyroles in their ecosystems. Sampling directly from the environment the DNA information contained in their genome - coined as metagenomics - allows to study the composition, diversity and functions of the organisms in microbiomes.

I am interested in developing data science methods to unveil information from microbiomes through the lens of DNA inforamtion. More specifically, I am currently working on the following topics:

### General interests

Bioinformatics:
 * Abundance sequences classification
 * Metagenomics and viral metagenomics
 * Metagenome-wide association studies
 * Protein structure classification

Computer science:
 * Supervised and unsupervised classification

### Projects

* (Viral) metagenomics sequence annotations
* Binning
* Human gut MWAS
* Gene calling for metagenomics
* High throughput remote homology detection

### Publications
